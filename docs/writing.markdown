Hi friends,

Whenever I get the chance, I like to spend a few minutes writing about what I'm learning and sharing it here. Thanks for reading.

I write a [blog](https://danieldelves.substack.com/) called Daniel Delves with my notes about venture capital, frontier technology, new markets, and the future of our world. I also write about health, wellness, and productivity. Subscribe [here](https://danieldelves.substack.com/welcome) to get it delivered directly to your inbox:

Daniel's Digest is [my weekly newsletter](https://danielsdigest.substack.com/) where I write about health, productivity, and mindset. Included are my thoughts, reflections, and notes from the week. Also included are some things I've enjoyed that week and articles that resonated with me. Iâ€™ll be sharing it every Sunday. Subscribe [here](https://danielsdigest.substack.com/welcome):

I host the [Absolute Value](https://anchor.fm/daniel-ling) podcast, where my guests and I explore emerging technology, future trends, and the various ways we can live to our fullest potential and become the best versions of ourselves.

Guests include leaders in science, technology, business, and government, etc. New episodes every week or so. The main podcast website can be found [here](https://absolutevaluepodcast.github.io).

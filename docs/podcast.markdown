I host the [Absolute Value](https://anchor.fm/daniel-ling) podcast, where my guests and I explore emerging technology, future trends, and the various ways we can live to our fullest potential and become the best versions of ourselves. Topics include applied math, investing, and the foundational concepts that help us live happy, healthy, and productive lives. Guests include world leaders in science, technology, business, and government, etc. New episodes every week or so.

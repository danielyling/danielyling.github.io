I"T<p>Hi friends,</p>

<p>Whenever I get the chance, I like to spend a few minutes writing about what I’m learning and sharing it here. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>I write a blog called Daniel Delves with notes about venture capital, frontier technology, new markets, and the future of our world. I also write about health, wellness, and productivity.</p>

<p>Daniel’s Digest is my weekly newsletter where I write about health, productivity, and mindset. Included are my thoughts, reflections, and notes from the week. Also included are some things I’ve enjoyed that week and articles that resonated with me. I’ll be sharing it every Sunday. Subscribe <a href="https://danielsdigest.substack.com/">here</a> to get it delivered directly to your inbox or read it here.</p>

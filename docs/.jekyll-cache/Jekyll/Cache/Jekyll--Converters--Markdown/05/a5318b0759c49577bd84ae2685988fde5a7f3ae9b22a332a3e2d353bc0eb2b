I"<p>I <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/25/37/375102/meta">published</a> an applied mathematics <a href="/Journal of Condensed Matter Physics 2013 publication.pdf">paper</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Physics:_Condensed_Matter">Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter</a> (July 2013). The research proposes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-hitting-time_model">first-passage-time</a> distribution model of single-molecule translocation. The paper has currently been cited over <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=7438379985292715049">40 times</a>. It appears to be getting attention from publications in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)">Nature</a> [(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12787">1</a>), (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03287">2</a>), (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38558#s1">3</a>)], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology_(journal)">Nanotechnology</a> (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710574/">1</a>), among other journals. I’m excited to see how this impact continues in the future.</p>

<p>My research in applied math appears in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JPCM...25K5102Y">Harvard’s High Energy Physics Library</a>, the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Physics</a>, and <a href="http://cds.cern.ch/record/1554730">CERN</a>. My research is published in condensed matter <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2412">libraries</a> as well. As a financial sponsor of my research, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health">NIH</a> also currently <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4778962/">features my publication</a>.</p>

<p>My research in nanoparticle inorganic chemistry can be found <a href="http://nhsjs.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/07/AuAg-NP_GFP-Final.pdf">here</a>. The research was also published <a href="https://www.microscopy.org/MandM/2011/abstracts/LB-44.pdf">here</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscopy_Society_of_America">Microscopy Society of America</a>. I was an invited speaker at their <a href="https://www.microscopy.org/MandM/2011/posterabstracts.cfm">annual conference</a> in Nashville, TN.</p>

<p>I’ve conducted physics research at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> in the fields of condensed matter and biophysics. I have also conducted research at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Sloan_Kettering_Cancer_Center">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> on topics including biophysics, structural biology, and cancer therapy under <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/alexandros-pertsinidis">Dr. Alexandros Pertsinidis (physicist)</a>. Contributed to publications within the <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski">Sloan Kettering Institute</a>.</p>

<p>I continue to be greatly interested in physics and chemistry, especially in conjunction with the applied math foundations of economics, financial markets, and policy. Placed out of ECO 100/101 at Princeton and completed core economic theory coursework by end of sophomore year.</p>

<p>I conducted my <a href="https://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01bn9999183">senior thesis</a> at Princeton on applications of game theory and mechanism design in loan markets with information asymmetry. The thesis focuses on applied math in economics and contract theory. It was an honor to be advised by Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Morris_(game_theorist)">Stephen E. Morris</a>, economist and game theorist.</p>

<p>My thesis is available upon request.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went on a morning walk yesterday as the sun was going up, and it was glorious. It was my first morning walk in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quiet and serene. A multitude of birds were out and about in my neighborhood. I could still hear the quiet but ever present hum of the remaining nighttime grasshoppers chirping. And of course, the steady patter of my footsteps underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been so grateful to be in a serene environment. I’ve worked in two of the major U.S. urban centers since graduating from college, and have enjoyed every minute of it. But I feel we can often take for granted the serene moments and tranquil settings that we may find ourselves in. We often yearn for commotion, volatility. But it’s important to cherish our serene surroundings when we do have it. While many of us are working remotely during this time of COVID-19, may we seek out the moments of solitude and calmness when we can. It’s good to disconnect for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great week!&lt;br /&gt;
Daniel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-that-resonated-with-me-this-week&quot;&gt;Things that resonated with me this week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was moved by Lauv’s performance &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjKruLdyXq0&amp;amp;list=RDVQdglo6mBcU&amp;amp;index=22&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He’s absorbed in his performance, as if he’s alone in the auditorium and it’s just him and the piano. For some reason, it’s always inspiring to see someone fully immersed in his or her craft.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tyler Adam’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk4wycbtfOw&quot;&gt;collectedness&lt;/a&gt; at his post-match interview, after having scored a game-winning goal to send his team to the Champions League semifinal, was inspiring (perhaps more than so than the goal itself). His maturity at such a young age is something I try to strive for myself, even though I’m a few years older. We are never too young to display maturity and composure, even when things can get a little crazy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I recently read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raindance.co.uk/site/scripts/Inception.pdf&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; for Inception without any audio or visuals, and it was inspiring to see how much of the initial writing dictated the filming and eventual final reel. Some of the written scenes described the final rendered output to the tee. Some did not, but it was remarkable to see how some scenes went straight from Christopher Nolan envisioning, to making it on the final screen. I think this is one of the obvious benefits of “vertically integrating” the directing and screenwriting process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;things-im-trying-out&quot;&gt;Things I’m trying out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Checking email once per day. I think setting a consistent time stabilizes the mind, and having no structure around this can quickly get out of hand. It also teaches you to be succinct and efficient with your writing to maximize your productivity when you are in your inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I recently realized that the word breakfast may have come from the notion of “breaking the fast”, after essentially fasting overnight. The metabolism halts during this period, and, with the first meal of the day, we’re breaking this fast and jumpstarting our energy production processes. With this in mind, I’m aiming to eat breakfast within an hour of waking up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stuff-thats-on-my-mind&quot;&gt;Stuff that’s on my mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s important to disengage and write sometimes. And to write from a place of intentionality. We can get lost in the natural entropy of life, and it’s essential to sit back and write sometimes. With your own thoughts undisturbed. Not only is it cathartic, but it’s also a process of self-discovery; you discover new things and new ideas along the way, just from the process of putting pen to paper. I’m making this a habit of at least once a week of long-form writing, and journaling each day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quote-of-the-week&quot;&gt;Quote of the week&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In present day market environments, network effects drive about 70% of value for technology companies and technology-enabled services. Emerging trends in AI point to many potential areas where network effects can amplify product utility and customer adoption, and in turn drive a large portion of market value for technology companies. It can be hugely valuable in early product development to architect a product to allow users to participate in value creation, and effectively let the use of the product add value to the other users. Every incremental customer can effectively add value to each existing customer, as well as each future customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional model of network effects contends that the network of customers utilizing a product provides the majority of the value of the project, versus the product itself. Prime examples are in the social media space, with industry titans like Facebook and Instagram, where their existing networks of users deliver the most value for each incremental user that signs up. Companies like Craigslist and Ebay illustrate network effects in its purest form, as they rely entirely on their network of users to deliver their value proposition, as evidenced by the success of their marketplaces in congruence with their bare interfaces (all of their value is derived from the network of users interacting on their tech-enabled marketplace platforms, not in branding, marketing, or any other product dimension).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Types of Network Effects in AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a recent survey from Gartner shows that 37% of organizations worldwide have adopted some form of AI, which is a growth rate of 270% within the past four years. It appears that, with the emergence of data sharing within networks and novel AI applications, new types of network effects may come about and bring value to AI startups specifically. For example, new types of network effects come about with new network participants that interact with &amp;amp; benefit from a startup’s AI, which brings about new categorizations for the network effect itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example an AI startup that creates a robotic arm to replace restaurant workers at fast-casual restaurants. The restaurant “enterprises” themselves form a network of direct customers of the AI startup, adopting the robotic arm technology for operational enhancements. Simultaneously, the customers in the restaurant (the restaurants themselves serving as the first layer) are also part of the network, and also benefit from the cleanliness and improved preparation of the food (assuming the startup’s product works and their value-prop is substantiated) among other positive externalities (e.g. improved health outcomes). This secondary layer (with delivery platforms, other restaurant components, serving as tertiary layers) essentially benefits from the positive externalities of the AI’s introduction into the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interaction of these layers appears to introduce a new type of network effect particular to AI startups (and tied to the business impacts of automation), which could be described as vertical network effects (similar in concept to the “vertical integration” of a business’s operations), across the chain of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example that demonstrates the vertical nature of AI network effects is a startup that provides robotic farming automation for picking fruits and vegetables. A business that vertically integrates is aiming to operationally control the production of vegetables from farm, to wholesale distribution, to retail, to customer. Network effects play a role in a similar vertical fashion here, where the farm’s harvesting operations are automated and enhanced, downstream distributors benefit from greater quantities and higher quality produce with peak ripeness and lower wholesale purchase costs, and further upstream, fertilizer companies are benefitting from the operational expansion of the farm’s capabilities, which require larger purchases of fertilizer. The network of buyers of the produce at the end of the consumption chain also benefit from the improved produce quality and enhanced ripeness. Thus, across vertical network participants, network effects arise from a stimulus of transactions, consumption, and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complete this particular lens of viewing network effects, the conventional model of network effects would indicate more of a horizontal network effect, among the “same type” of network participants, i.e. within the category of fertilizer types (in farming AI), delivery types (in restaurant AI), and individual users (in social media).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Categories of Network Effects in AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With emerging AI technologies that are creating entirely new markets and redefining existing methodologies, there appear to also be new categories of network effects that come with it. One distinct category that has emerged is adaptive learning in AI, with startups building technologies that adaptively learn with new data in searching for an optimum, whether that be an optimal decision or optimal product. This could be a farming automation startup that is building an AI to detect peak ripeness, for example. Another category appears to be network effects that purely arise from existing networks of customers or users. The social media platforms described above, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, would fit this model. It’ll be interesting to see how new categories of network effects are defined with each new AI that goes-to-market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Business Operations &amp;amp; Go-To-Market Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognition of the immense positive impacts and value of network effects in AI should impact how a business operates, goes-to-market, and scales. With network effects in mind, business strategy should be developed with the direct consumers of the product in mind, as well as the indirect beneficiaries of the product, which can occur downstream or upstream (e.g. in the farming automation example), which in turn create positive feedback loops that reinforce business operations and sales channels at each stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Effects in Data Generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network effects in general add value to a business with each new node or user that is added. A data network effect specifically occurs when newly added data continuously improves a product or service. As the usage of the product grows, the data contributed by each user grows, and the product improves with the aggregated data. Data network effects provide an inherent advantage to a vast array of companies, especially those that are AI/ML based, by allowing them to leverage their customer data more effectively. Data network effects can be derived from the data generated from large, anonymous groups of people that engage with the company’s products. Recommendation systems, for example, benefit from the network effects stemming from the large and continuously growing supply of data that is generated from the user base. The deeper the data set, the better the recommendations that can be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide further granularity, data generation also provides positive network effects for each “participant category.” One participant category is the set of users of the product, which largely generate the data in question. Another auxiliary category is the set of secondary beneficiaries or those positively affected by the product. The larger dataset improves the product, which in turn results in an enhanced product experience for the initial set of users. This positive feedback loop creates a data network effect via data generation or aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data network effects can be described as a flywheel feedback loop, with customers generating data that in turn informs prediction models &amp;amp; algos, which in turn brings in more customers. Data continues to aggregate and the process amplifies. Moreover, businesses can unlock immense competitive advantages by utilizing AI/ML, given the potential for competitive moats with data network effects. Data network effects can build defensibility and add value through increased user retention and alignment to user preferences through prediction models and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Effects in Synthetic Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data network effects can also play a role in synthetic data generation. Synthetic data products adaptively learn as more data is generated, and the convenience of availability is a huge value proposition. Apple, Google, and Microsoft have all published research that illustrates how synthetic data is highly convenient for machine learning and training models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Synthetic data appears to help startups compete with large-cap corporations that tend to have swsthes of data readily available. The ability to generate synthetic data creates a level playing field for startups to compete with data-rich giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adoption of synthetic data in AI practice is growing, and alongside that trend is a massive market opportunity for synthetic data platforms that can generate convenient and readily available data. Google researchers are now training AI in simulated worlds for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Addendum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Use Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data network effects can also play a role for platforms that are building autonomous vehicles. Tesla for example could benefit from strong data network effects, as its fleet of cars gathers data that drives continuous improvement of Tesla’s AI/ML, which could then be applied to navigation, automation, and other decision making processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roadmap for Leveraging Data Network Effects &amp;amp; Potential Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI/ML products tend to inherently exhibit data network effects, but not all companies are able to leverage these effects to their advantage. Complexity of data poses one limitation, leading to the growing importance of data management and data scientists. Further downstream, the potential for competitive advantage also is dependent on the specific use case. While recommender systems are a popular use case where AI/ML has provided companies with data network effects that give rise to competitive advantages, the same positive effects are hard to unlock in facial recognition, home devices, and certain subareas of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="post" /><summary type="html">Market Landscape and Context</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/blog/post/2020/08/10/Hello!" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello!" /><published>2020-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/blog/post/2020/08/10/Hello!</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/blog/post/2020/08/10/Hello!">&lt;p&gt;Hello, World!

&lt;p&gt;There were many fascinating aspects of Wilson’s career and approach that I discovered while reading this book, but one thing stood out that I wanted to discuss briefly. His devotion to his faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book shed light on aspects of Wilson’s life that aren’t readily apparent, and one area of his life that resonated with me was his unwavering commitment to Christianity (it should be noted that I did not grow up in a Christian household).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson did not actively preach his faith to others, but he ardently practiced it internally. He did not wish to evangelize or sermonize outwardly, especially towards others who may have held different beliefs, but he practiced it himself and let it guide his decisions. He infused every one of his decisions with a moral compass that he devoted himself to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[This goes back to a concept that I’ll discuss later on, and that I’ve seen in a lot of successful people - the notion that being devoted and dedicated to something, in and of itself, can lead to greater benefits in our lives. But more on that later].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This commitment also permeated his political decision-making:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He placed principles before politics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He followed his conscience, never first checking public opinion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He spoke only for himself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even so, he found much of the nation agreeing with what he had to say anyways. Even though he never first reviewed the opinions of the American public to guide his decision-making, his decisions, based on his conscience before anyone else, ended up agreeing with them anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was evident. The public resonated with a person so visibly dedicated to underlying principles rather than frothy political motives. It came through in every public speech he gave.
